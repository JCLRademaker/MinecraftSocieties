Games and Agents project.

## The Demo
The demo that will be shown during the presentation.

### What it does
### Running the demo
To run the demo have 2 instances of Minecraft active

Then run `$ python main.py` in the `/MinecraftSocieties` folder

If the agent happens to skip the chest when trying to put items in it, it is best to take control of
the agent by pressing "enter", look at the chest so that changes can be registered, and then give back control
to the agent by pressing "enter" again. The skipping could happen because of intense frame skips (thanks Malmo).

The above method also applies to other situations in which the agent could have skipped an object.
